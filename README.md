# House-Prices-Prediction-with-linear-regression

## Overview
In this simple ML project, I applied feature extraction, data cleaning and Supervised ML on House Prices dataset from kaggle to construct a model that can accuratly predict house prices using many diffrent features both numerical and categorical.
I also used RMAE and R2 score to measure my model performance.

## Considerations
The datasheet included is the train.csv as it is found on kaggle, a manual feature extraction must be applied.
